The client needed to find missing pieces from the returned LEGO sets before shipping them to other users. They had an existing image recognition system but it wasn’t very efficient and accurate. Solution: We integrated our own self-improving, Deep Learning-based Image Recognition system with client’s existing one via a robust web API. This new integrated system could now be used by anyone without prior knowledge of Computer Vision. Impact: 70% reduced human effort and further reduction in cost by taking over the remaining 30% manual work. Client: Provider of high-end real estate photography solutions Problem: The client used to edit and enhance photos manually with a team of 10-12 editors. This was subject to human errors and needed long processing time for each property. Solution: Using a mix of Deep Learning and proven, predictable techniques in computational photography, we automated editing work with minimal human intervention. The system enhanced indoor and outdoor photos taken under varying lighting conditions. Impact: Complete automation up to 90% from image classification, segmentation and enhancement.

CASE STUDY #2: REAL ESTATE PHOTOGRAPHY CASE STUDY #3: FACE RECOGNITION FOR A DRONE Client: Autonomous drone technology provider Problem: Port our facial recognition system onto an embedded device (Jetson TX2) that was not yet fully supported by Deep Learning frameworks like Tensorflow at the time. We had to deal with low resolution video data with severe compression artifacts, motion blur and lens distortion. Solution: A Deep Learning-based Face Recognition system was deployed on a drone. Impact: We built a Proof-of-Concept system for the client that enabled them to win new Government projects. Client: Mobile phone app SDK creator Problem: Client had a patent on liveness detection for face recognition based on two pictures of a person’s face, taken from two distances. Instead of treating recognition and liveness detection as two separate problems, they wanted to train a single AI model that incorporated the two images for better accuracy on both tasks (prior to Apple’s Face ID). Solution: Our Deep Learning-based approach significantly improved their recognition system that was based on proven and predictable Computer Vision techniques while incorporating spoof detection in the same model. Impact: On extremely challenging examples under arbitrary lighting conditions, their recognition rate improved to over 95% with a false positive rate of 1 in 10,000.

CASE STUDY #4: FACE RECOGNITION FOR A SMARTPHONE CASE STUDY #5: REAL TIME VIDEO MONITORING Client: Provider of video security solutions Problem: The client builds software for monitoring high security regions to spot sophisticated intruders. The system needed to work in a low light environment with unusual sources of visual noise like wild animals. The new system needed to dramatically decrease false alarm rate by using a combination of Artificial Intelligence and humans in the loop. Solution: We implemented a two-stage AI solution. A lightweight motion detector was used on the edge cameras. On the server, a precise human intruder detector was implemented using GPU instances on Amazon Web Services. The training system used a state-of-the-art object detection and tracking algorithm trained using a large dataset annotated by our data team. The server filtered out non-human motion, and thus, significantly reduced the number of frames sent to human observers in high security applications. Impact: We implemented a scalable system to handle thousands of camera feeds simultaneously that could be manned by a few operators. Client: Provider of identity document authentication services Problem: Implement 1) Document rectification, 2) Fraud and tamper detection, 3) OCR for ID Type 1 (e.g. driver’s license, credit cards, etc.), ID Type 2 (e.g. South African green book) and ID Type 3 (e.g. passports). models to correctly align the documents.

We developed Deep Learning-based algorithms that automatically detect several different kinds of tampers in digital ID documents. Client’s inability to share real data with us for privacy reasons forced us to synthetically create a dataset of 10 million images to train an OCR model. The synthetic dataset realistically simulated hundreds of fonts, guilloche patterns, lighting conditions, document curvature, blur & noise. Impact: The client was able to capture a large portion of the US document authentication market in the last 4 years with major banks and cell phone carriers using their service. CASE STUDY #6: ID DOCUMENT ANALYSIS Solution: Document rectification combined proven and predictable models and Computer Vision algorithms, with state-of-the-art background subtraction CASE STUDY #7: MULTI-CAMERA SPORTS ANALYTICS Client: Sports analytics company Problem: Develop a multi-camera system for tracking soccer ball and players in a soccer match, and generate detailed match analytics (e.g. ball possession) and per-player analytics (e.g. quality of corner kick).

Client: Security and surveillance Problem: Identifying an active shooter in surveillance camera footage in a school environment. Solution: Compared to most object detection problems, this one required an extremely low false positive rate and a very high detection rate for an extremely rare event (shooting). The system was trained on a large, manually-collected dataset of people holding weapons and non-weapons (cellphones). Impact: The project was implemented as a Proof-of-Concept funded by individual investors. The success of this project helped the client raise venture capital to form a company. CASE STUDY #12: SHOOTER IDENTIFICATION CASE STUDY #13: AUTOMATED COVID TESTING Client: Medical diagnostic company Problem: Develop algorithm for automating their COVID testing workflow. Solution: We trained a Deep Learning model that automatically segments and reads the lines on COVID cassettes normally done by medical experts.

Introduction to SQL SQL stands for Structural Query Language, and SQL is used for storing, manipulation, and retrieving data from the database. History of SQL The SQL(Structural Query language) was first created in the 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. The Query language, known then as SEQUEL, was created following the publishing of Edgar Frank Todd's paper, In 1970, A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks. In his paper, Todd proposed that all the data in a database be represented in the form of relations. It was based on this theory that Chamberlin and Boyce came up with SQL. The original SQL version was designed to retrieve and manipulate data stored in IBM's original RDBMS known as \" System R.\" It wasn't until several years later, however, that the Structural Query language was made available publicly. In 1979, a company named as Relational Software, which later beca me Oracle, commercially released its version of the SQL language called Oracle V2. Since that time, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization have deemed the SQL language as the standard language in relational database communication. While major SQL vendors do modify the language to their desires, mos t base their SQL programs off of the ANSI approved version. What",

While major SQL vendors do modify the language to their desires, mos t base their SQL programs off of the ANSI approved version. What is Database? A database is a well-ordered collection of data. A database is an electronic system that permits data to be easily manipulated, accessed, and updated, or an organization uses a database as a method of managing, storing, and retrieving information. Modern databases are handled using a database management system (DBMS). Relational Database Relational Database s are used to store data in tables (rows and columns ). Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. SQL and Relational Databases A Relational Database contains tables that store the data that is related in some way. SQL is the query language that allows retrieval and manipulation of table data in the relational database. The database below has two tables: one with data on Users and another with data on Products.

T he t able includes records(rows) with Data. To access those records, we need SQL Syntax. Most of the action you need to perform Database by using the SQL Statement. Note: SQL keywords are not case-sensitive (e.g., select as SELECT) o The syntax of the language describes the language element. o SQL syntax is somewhat like simple English sentences. o Keywords include SELECT, UPDATE, WHERE, ORDER BY ETC. Four fundamental operations that can apply to any databases are: 1. Read the Data -- SELECT 2. Insert the new Data -- INSERT 3. Update existing Data -- UPDATE 4. Remove Data –DELETE These operations are referred to as the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The SQL SELECT QUERY The SELECT statement permits you to read data from one or more tables. The",

The general syntax is: SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer; Example: Read the first_name and last_name from table customer. To select all columns, use * SELECT * FROM customer; The SQL SELECT DISTINCT The SELECT DISTINCT statement is to return the different values. SELECT DISTINCT first_name FROM customer; The SQL WHERE CLAUSE The WHERE clause allows the user to filter the data from the table. The WHERE clause allows the user to extract only those records that satisfy a specified condition. When we access, the Text value SQL requires single quotes around text values (many database systems will also use double quotes). And numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes. SELECT first_name FROM customer WHERE last_name = ‘perry’; When we access the Numeric field SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE active = 0; Operators in where clause = Equal > Greater than  Less than >= Greater than equal = Less than equal  > Not equal (also written as!=) BETWEEN Between a range LIKE Search for pattern IN Specify multiple possible values for a column The SQL WHERE CLAUSE WITH AND, OR & NOT A WHERE clause with AND:",

The SQL STORED PROCEDURE What is a SQL Stored Procedure? The stored procedure is a prepared SQL query that you can save so that the query can be reused over and over again. So, if the user has an SQL query that you write over and over again, keep it as a stored procedure and execute it. Users can also pass parameter s to a stored procedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value that is given. Stored Procedure Syntax CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name AS sql_statement GO; Execute a Stored Procedure EXEC procedure_name; 4. SQL JOIN The SQL Join help in retrieving data from two or more database tables. The tables are mutually related using primary keys and foreign keys. Type of Join INNER JOIN The INNER JOIN is used to print rows from both tables that satisfy the given condition.

The SQL INSERT INTO STATEMENT The INSERT INTO statement in SQL is used to insert new records in a table. INSERT INTO query We can write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways.

However, ensure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. The INSERT INTO query would be as follows: INSERT INTO customer VALUES (3, ‘Antonio, ‘Moreno, ‘Mexico’, ‘Mexico’, (5) 555-3932); We have inserted two rows yet.

If the field in a table is optional, to insert new data or update data without adding a value to this field and Then, the field will be saved as a NULL value. Note: A NULL value is not the same as a zero value, or we can say a field that holds spaces. The field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation! Insert the NULL values in tables INSERT INTO customer VALUES(11, ‘Victoria’, ‘Ashworth’, ‘London’, NULL, ‘(171) 555-1212’) As we can able to see, the last row contains one NULL value. How to check for NULL Values? To test for NULL values in the table has to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

The SQL CONSTRAINTS The Constraints in SQL can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is altered with the ALTER TABLE statement. Syntax: CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype constraint, column2 datatype constraint, column3 datatype constraint,.... ); SQL Constraints SQL constraints are used to specify any rules for the records in a table. Constraints can be used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. It ensures the accur acy and reliability of the records in the table, and i f there is any violation between the constraint and the record action, the action is aborted. Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table - level constraints apply to the whole table. The constraints are commonly used in SQL CONSTRAINTS DESCRIPTION Not Null It Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value. Unique It Ensures that all the values in a column are unique.

Primary Key It is a combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table. Foreign Key Uniquely identifies a record /row in another table Check It checks that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition Default It gives a default value for a column when no value is specified Index It is Used to create and retrieve data from the database quickly. NOT NULL CONSTRAINTS The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column NOT to accept NULL values. This imposes a field always to contain a value, which means that the user cannot insert a new record in a table or update a record without adding a value to this field. NOTE: By default, a column can hold NULL values. Create a table using SQL not null constraints The following SQL ensures that the \" id\", \"First _name\" and \"Last_name\" columns will NOT accept NULL values when the \"student\" table is created: Example CREATE TABLE student( id int NOT NULL, first_name varchar(25) NOT NULL, last_name varchar(25) NOT NULL, age int ); In the above table, it has specified the id, first_name, and last_name as not null and age as null.

SQL UNIQUE CONSTRAINT The UNIQUE constraint in SQL ensures that all values in a column are distinct. UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints both provides a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or group of columns. A PRIMARY KEY constraint, by default, has a UNIQUE constraint. However, the user can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.

ALTER TABLE persons ADD UNIQUE (first_name); Now we have two unique constraints(id and first_name) in the person table. To name the UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax: ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAINT UC_person UNIQUE (age, last_name); Here the age and last_name are converted as unique constraints. DROP A UNIQUE CONSTRAINT To drop a UNIQUE constraint, use the SQL query ALTER TABLE person DROP INDEX UC_Person; As we can see in the person table The unique constraint(UC_Persons) has been dropped. SQL PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINTS The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each of the records in a table. O nly ONE primary key can have in a table. A nd also, in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields). Primary keys should contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

SQL FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT A FOREIGN KEY is used to link two table s together. It is sometimes also called a referencing key. Foreign Key is a combination of columns (can be single column) whose value matches a Primary Key in the different table s. The relationship between two tables matches the Primary Key in one of the tables with a Foreign Key in the second table. If the table contains a primary key defined on any field, then the user should not have two records having the equal value of that field. Let’s create two tables using the foreign key.

SQL CREATE INDEX STATEMENT CREATE INDEX statement in SQL is used to create indexes in tables. The indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than others. The user can not see the indexes, and they are just used to speed up queries /searches. Note: Updating the table with indexes takes a lot of time than updating a table without indexes. It is because the indexes also need an update. So, only create indexes on those columns that will be frequently searched against. CREATE INDEX Syntax It creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed: CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2,...); Example: Creates an index named \"idex_lastname\" on the \"LastName\" column in the \"Persons\" table: CREATE INDEX idex_",

Syntax: Create UNIQUE INDEX index_name on table_name (column1, column2,...); Note: The query for creating indexes varies among different databases. Therefore, Check the query for creating indexes in your database. DROP INDEX STATEMENT The DROP INDEX statement in SQL is used to delete an index in a table. ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX index_name; 8. SQL VIEWS STATEMENT In SQL, the view is a virtual table based on the result -set of an SQL statement. A view holds rows and columns, similar to a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. CREATE VIEW Syntax CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2,... FROM table_name WHERE condition; Note: A view always shows up -to-date data! The database engine recreates the data, using the view's SQL statement, every time a user queries a view. Create a table customer Create a view on the table customers. Here, the view would be used to have a customer name and age from the customers table. CREATE VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW AS SELECT name, age FROM customers; The WITH CHECK OPTION The WITH CHECK OPTION in SQL is a CREATE VIEW statement option. The objective of the WITH CHECK OPTION is to make sure that all UPDATE and INSERTs satisfy the condition(s) in the view definition. If they do not satisfy the condition(s), the UPDATE or INSERT returns an error. The following code block has an example of creating the same view CUSTOMERS_VIEW with the WITH CHECK OPTION. CREATE VIEW CUSTOMER_VIEW AS SELECT name, age FROM customers WHERE age IS NOT NULL WITH CHECK OPTION; Here we have created a view(CUSTOMER_VIEW) with the check option. D",

DELETING ROWS INTO A VIEW Rows of data can be deleted from a view. The same rules that apply to the UPDATE and INSERT commands apply to the DELETE command. Example Delete a record having AGE = 25. DELETE FROM CUSTOMER_VIEW WHERE age = 25; Here we have deleted the row, which contains the age = 25. DROPPING VIEWS Where the user has a view, you need a method to drop the view if it is no longer needed. The query is straightforward and is given below: DROP VIEW view_name; It’s similar to the other dropping option, as we have done yet for tables. As we can see, the view is not available in the database after dropping the view. 9.

So, if the user has an SQL query that you write over and over again, keep it as a stored procedure and execute it. Users can also pass parameters to a stored pr ocedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value that is given. 9.1.1. Creating the Stored Procedure Syntax for creating a Stored Procedure DELIMITER $$ CREATE PROCEDURE PROCEDURE_NAME() BEGIN SELECT Column_name1, Column_name2,........... FROM Table_name END$$ DELIMITER Here, the DELIMITER is not the part of Query, the first Delimiter is change the default delimiter to // and the second delimiter is change the delimiter to the default. The Stored procedure is saved automatically in the database while creation. To execute the query in MySQL, use the MySQL workbench for better user -interface, and use inbuilt databases to perform the advance MySQL queries. Here we have create a procedure called Customer, and we have mentioned few column names in it. And in last we have closed the procdure.

EXECUTION OF STORE PROCEDURE Execution of the Stored Procedure is very simple by using the CALL procedure_name, Execute the below query to get the result of the defined stored procedure. After calling the procedure, we are able to see the selected columns which are mentioned in the procedure. The output is as follow: Stored Procedue can have parameters,so while execution we can pass the argument and get the result. We can use control flow (like: IF, LOOP, CASE, etc.)in the stored procedure to make dynamic queries and also we can pass one stored procedure inside the other which will help to modulize the queries. 9.1.3. DROP THE STORED PROCEDURE Drop procedure use to delete the stored procedure from the databases. The following query used to delete the stored procedure for the Database: DROP Stored_procedure_name The below syntax used for conditionally drop of stored_procedure and first it check the procedure_name & if it exist then drop the stored procedure from the database. DROP PROCEDURE [IF EXIST] Stored_procedure_name; If the stored procedure is not available then it throw an error like mentioned below. 9.1.4.

The parameters make the Stored Procedure more flexible and useful. DEFINING A PARAMETERS To define the parameter inside the stored procedure, run the below query: [ IN | OUT | INPUT ] PARAMETER_NAME datatype[(length)] IN Parameter It is the default parameter in Stored Procedure and the calling program should pass an argument to stored Procedure. The valu e of IN is protected that means even the IN value is changed inside the stored procedure the original value will retained after end of the Stored Procedure. Example for IN: Create a Stored Procedure that find all the active customers by the input parameter as Active. Output: Out Parameter The value of the Output Parameter can be changed inside the Store Procedure and pass the new value while calling the Stored Procedure. Example for OUT: write a stored procedure to print the square root of a number. Output: The my_sqrt stored procedure has two parameters. input_number : it takes input from user in interger format. out_number : it store the output of the function. To print the output, we have call the my_sqrt() and pass the arguments, the first argument is user input and second is output, and to show the output use select @out_number.

STORED PROCEDURE VARIABLES In this unit we will learn about the variables, and also how to declare variables? How to use the variables?. Basically a variable is a called as data object whose value can be change while execution of Stored Procedure. DECLARING THE VARIABLE To declare the variable inside a stored procedure, use the below query: DECLARE Variable_name datatype(size) [DEFAULT Default_value]; Here, DECLARE – It is a keyword and it is use to declare the variable. First write DECLARE keyword and then variable_name. Datatype(size) – it us use to define the variable datatype (like: IN, Varchar, or char)and size use to define the length of the variable. Default – it assign variabl e with default value option. If we declare the variable without specifying any default values, then it’s values will be NULL.

ASSIGNING VARIABLE Once we declare the variable, now it is ready to use. To assign a value to the variable use SET statement: The value of the variable Total is assigned as 10. We can declare and create the variable in stored procedure as follow: Here we have assigned two variables and using under stored procedure to print the difference between two numbers(x and y). Let’s call the stored Procedure to check the output of the above code. And the output is below: VARIABLE SCOPE Variable scope is for limited time period. It is defined inside the stored procedure within BEGIN and it will be out of scope once the END statement reaches. When we declare any variable inside the BEGIN END Statement, it will be out of scope once the END statement reached, there after we cannot use it. 9.2. CONDITIONAL STATEMENT In this unit we will learn about the IF statement in MySQL and we will also learn about how to write the Conditional-Statement in MySQL. In MySQL, Conditional- Statement has three forms: IF-THEN, IF-THEN-ELSE and IF-THEN- ELSEIF-ELSE. Here we are going to learn about conditional statement in details one by one. 9.2.1.

Here is the syntax for IF-THEN: IF condition THEN Statement; END IF; Here, First, it will check the condition to execute the statement between the IF-THEN and END IF and if the condition is TRUE, otherwise it will go to the next END IF. In the above query, we are checking the condition as if the subject is as ‘computer’ then set the course as ‘B.Tech’. Let’s check the output of the stored procedure ‘student_ifthen’. As we can see here, the course is coming as B.Tech, because we set the condition as like that. 9.2.2. IF-THEN-ELSE STATEMENT IF-THEN-ELSE is similar to the IF-THEN. Where we will execute a block of code on a particular condition and if the condition will not satisfy then it will go for else block.

CASE STATEMENT In this unit, we are going to learn about the CASE statement, it is an alternative conditional statement for the IF-Statement and CASE statement makes the code more efficient and readable. CASE statement has two forms: Simple CASE and Searched CASE. So, let’s learn about the CASE statement and their use using the Stored Procedure. 9.3.1. Simple CASE Statement The simple CASE statement sequentially compare the case_values in with the when_values until it finds as equal. The basic syntax for the Simple CASE statement: CASE case_value When when_values THEN statement..... [ELSE else-statements] END CASE; If the case_values will not be equal to the when_values then it will execute the else statement. And if the else is also not satisfied then it will throw an error as CASE not found for CASE Statement. To avoid the er ror when the case_value will not equal to when_values then we can use an empty BEGIN END block in the else block as follows: CASE case_value When when_values THEN statement..... [ELSE else-statements] BEGIN END; END CASE; Here we are going to do same operation as IF conditional statement. We are going to check the subjects are",

If the condition is not satisfied under the CASE statement then the ELSE block will get executed. Let’s run the query and call the Stored Procedure. Now we will print the Case statement as follow: And also, Now, Let’s see the else block, if the case_values are not satisfied then else block will executed. As we can see, the else part is executed ans showing “subject is not available”. 9.3.2. Searched CASE Statement Searched CASE Statement is similar to Simple Case Statement but it only allows you to compare a value with a set of distinct values. It is equivalent to the IF Statement but it is more readable than IF Statement. To perform the more complex matches (like ranges), we use the Searched CASE Statement. The syntax is as follow: CASE case_value When when_values THEN statement........ [ELSE else-statements] END CASE; The searched CASE statement check each Seach_condition inside the WHEN clause until it finds as TRUE then it will execute the corresponding THEN statement.

If the search_condition is not satisfied then the CASE evaluates the ELSE Statement. We are going to search the subject names and checking them that under which course the y existing. If the condition is true then it will execute and return the course name but if the condition is not satisfied then it will execute the else block. Here we are searching, when the subject name as ‘computer’ then return course as ‘B.Tech’. And if the condition is not satisfied then it will execute the else block and return as ‘subject is not available’. Let’s call the Stored Procedure & check the satisfied condition. Here we have passed the subject name as ‘computer’ and it is belongs in B.Tech. Let’s have a look on Output. Similarly, let’s execute the else part: As we can see here, it executed the else part of the Stored Procedure. And showing output as the ‘subject is not available’.

LOOP STATEMENT In MySQL, the LOOP statement is used to execute one or more than one statement repeatedly. The syntax for LOOP statement: [begin loop: ] loop Statement_list END LOOP [end_label] The loop executes the statement_list repeatedly one by one and the statement_list can be one or more and separated by the semicolon (;). To terminate the loop we use the LEAVE statement after the condition is successfully satisfied. The syntax for LOOP Statement with LEAVE Statement: [label]: LOOP IF Condition THEN LEAVE[label]; END IF; END LOOP; The LEAVE statement is exactly work as the break in other programming language. It will immediately exit from the loop. We are going to use the LOOP inside the Stored Procedure to print the even numbers from 1 to 10. To print the even number we need to implement two conditions: • The number should be less than 10. • The number should be divisible by 2. So let’s implement it using SQL query inside the Stored Procedure using the LOOP and IF-THEN Statement. The query is written below to print the even numbers from the 1 to 10.

Let’s call the stored procedure to check the result. As we can see, the output is the collection of the even numbers between 1 and 10. 9.5. WHILE LOOP STATEMENT WHILE loop is execute the block of codes until the condition TRUE. The syntax is written below: [begin loop:] WHILE condition DO Statement END WHILE [end_label] The WHILE statement will check the condition at the beginning of the each iteration and if the condition satisfied, then it execute the Statement until the condition is true. We can have one or more than one statements inside the DO and END WHILE. We are going to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using while loop inside the stored procedure. Let’s call the stored procedure and check the output of the above query. We can see here, the output of the query is the collection of the numbers from 1 to 10 (excluding 10). Because we have given the condition in a while loop as 10, so till that, it will print all the numbers from 1 to till 9. 9.6. REPEAT LOOP STATEMENT REPEAT statement is used to execute one or more statements until the condition satisfied. It is similar to the DO WHILE LOOP in C. The syntax for the REPEAT loop statement as follows: REPEAT Statement UNTIL condition END REPEAT Here, the REPEAT LOOP executes the statement before checking",

T herefore the statement will always execute at least once. It is also known as the post-test loop. Let’s print the numbers from 1 to 20(excluding 20) by using a REPEAT loop inside the st ored procedure. Let's check the output of the stored procedure by calling it. We have successfully printed the numbers from 1 to 20 by using the Repeat loop inside the stored procedure. 9.7. CURSOR MySQL cursor in Stored Procedure is used to iterate through a result set returned by a select statement. We use the cursor to handle a result set inside a stored procedure. A cursor allows you to iterate a set of rows returned by a select query and process through each row separately. MySQL cursor is read-only, Non-scrollable, and Asensitive. Syntax to write the cursor in the stored procedure: 1. Declare Cursor_name CURSOR from SELECT_Statement. The cursor is declared after the variable declaration; if you say before, then it will throw an error. 2. OPEN Cursor_name. We are open the cursor by using the OPEN statement and also OPEN initialize the result set for the cursor. 3. Declare CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND (Termination Statement) To declare not",

Declare CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND (Termination Statement) To declare not found a handler, we use the above query. The finished is a variab le that indicates the cursor has reached the end of the result list. 4. FETCH cursor name INTO variable_list. By using the FETCH statement, retrieve the next row pointed by the cursor and move to the next row in the result list. 5. Close cursor_name. By using the CLOSE, we deactivate the cursor and release the memory associated with it. Let’s understand cursor by implementing it on the tables. So, we are going to get emails from customers from the customer table. To implement it, we are going to use the above five steps. Let’s check the output by calling the stored procedure In the output set, we have finally extracted the top 5 emails and stored them in the email_list by using the cursor inside the stored procedure. 9.8. ERROR HANDLING MySQL ERROR HANDLING use s to encounter Errors in the stored procedure. Whenever any error occurs inside a stored procedure, it is very important to handle it. To handle that, MySQL is providing an easy way to define handlers that handle the errors (such as warnings or exception s to specific conditions). To declare the handler, we use the following syntax: DECLARE action HANDLER FOR condition statement; If the condition",

To handle that, MySQL is providing an easy way to define handlers that handle the errors (such as warnings or exception s to specific conditions). To declare the handler, we use the following syntax: DECLARE action HANDLER FOR condition statement; If the condition matches, then the MySQL will execute the statement and continue or exit from the code block based on the action. Action accepts one of the following values: CONTINUE: the execution of the code block is continuing. EXIT: the execution of the enclosing code block, where the handler is declared or terminated. Declaring the Error Handling for CONTINUE The following handler set the value of error variable equal to 1 and continues the execution if any error occurs; DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEEPTION SET error_variable = 1 Declaring the Error Handling for EXIT The following handler rolls back the previous operation, issues an error message and exit the current code block in case of error occurs. If we declare it inside the BEGIN END block of a stored procedure, it will terminate the stored procedure immediately. Let’s understand with an example of the error handler; so we are crea ting an employeedetails table and we are trying to pass the error handler (continue and exit). We have created a table with EmployeeDetails and given a constraint as pk_EmployeeDetails with primary key (EmpID). Let’s create a procedure to handle to continue error handler.

Here we have created a procedure, that will detect the duplicasy in data and throw an error message as error occurred. We are going to pass the values inside the table. It is giving this message because one error is occurred while inserting the data into the table, and the handler is found the duplicate data. But along with this, it will print the remaining values which will not have any duplicate data. We have inserted two rows succ essfully and third is not inserted because of duplicacy of data. As we have seen the CONTINUE error handler in the above example. Now let’s do an example with EXIT error handler using stored procedure. We are going to use the same table and same procedure except the error handler. In the below example, we are going to perform the error handler using the exit error handler, which is use to do the execution of the enclosing code block, where the handler is declared or terminated. Here we are inserting the two rows as follow: But the result of the error handler using the EXIT error handler will print the error message alone. It will not show the values which are inserted inside the table. When we call the stored procedur in EXIT handler, it will just give the error message as above. 9.8.1.

ERROR CONDITIONS WITH MySQL SIGNAL/ RESIGNAL STATEMENT SIGNAL STATEMENT Signal statement is used to return an error or warning conditions to the caller using the stored procedure. It is provide and easy way to get the message and the values based on our need. The syntax for SIGNAL statement: SIGNAL SQLSTATE | condition_name; SET condition_information_item_name = value1 SET condition_information_item_name = value2 SIGNAL keyword is a SQLSTATE values or condition name declare by using DECLARE CONDITION. The condition_information_item_name can beMESSAGE_TEXT, MYSQL_ERROR, CURSOR_NAME etc. Let’s create a stored procedure w ith customer table, where we are going to check the store_id and customer details. If the record is not found then it will give an error message as the “data not found in custmer table”. Note: 45000 is a generic SQLSTATE value that illustrates an unhandled user-defined exception. Output: As we can see here, the error message is giving as the “data not found in the customer table”. RESIGNAL STATEMENT RESIGNAL STATEMENT is used to raise a warning or error messages.

Output: As we can see here, the error message is giving as the “data not found in the customer table”. RESIGNAL STATEMENT RESIGNAL STATEMENT is used to raise a warning or error messages. It is similar to the SIGNAL statement in terms of functionality and the syntax,except: • We must have to use RESIGNAL statement inside the error handler, otherwise it will throw an error as “RESIGNAL when handler is not active”. • It can omit all the attributes of RESIGNAL statement, even the SQLSTATE values. We are creating a stored procedure to division of a number with any number, but if any number is divided by zero then it will throw an error message as the “divided by zero”. Let’s call the stored procedure to check the output, when we divide any number with zero. Here, we are dividing a n umber with zero, so it’s throwing an error message as “divided by zero/ denominator can not be zero”. 9.9. STORED FUNCTION STORED FUNCTION is a special type of the store program where we store the functions to encapsulate the common formulas and rule, and that are reusable. 9.9.1.

First we use to create the function with the CREATE FUNCTION function_name (pass the parameters in it). RETURN type is used to return the values/ statement. Then specify the fu nction as DETERNMINISTIC OR NON - DETERMINISTIC. MySQL uses NON-DETERMINISTIC by default. Now we are going to create a stored function on the student table. We are going to define if the subject_name is coming then it should print as their respective course_name. Let’s check the function output by calling it under the SELECT statement. We have selected the column as subject and applying the function at the subject. Let’s check the output of the function. As we can see, the function is giving the subject with their respective courses. 9.9.2. DROP FUNCTION The DROP FUNCTION is use to drop the created stored function from the database. By using the Syntax as: DROP FUNCTION function_name; If the FUNCTION is not exit, In that case check the condition as: DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS function_name; Let’s do an example to show case the above function. For that, we are going to drop the studentssubject() function. Now, let’s check the second command to drop the table. It throwing a warning message as function does not exists.

Suppose, you defined a trigger and you in sert a row inside the table, then it will automatically invoked before or after the insertion of row. There are two types of the TRIGGERS: 1. Row-level-Triggers: it is activated for each row that is inserted, deleted or updated. 2. Statement-level-Triggers: it is executed for each transaction. Note: It supports only Row-level-Triggers. Advantage of Triggers • It provides a way to check the integrity in data. • It can be useful for auditing the data changes in tables • It handles the errors from the database layer. 10.1. CREATING TRIGGERS CREATE TRIGGER statement is used to create the triggers. The syntax is following: CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name BEFORE | AFTER INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE  ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body; Here, • The first line is for creating the trigger with trigger_name. • It will make the condition that the trigger invokes before or after any modification in row. • The operation we can choose as INSERT,",

Let’s understand the triggers by using an example. Now, we are going to create a table names as EmployeeDetail. And defined a primary key as id; Create another table and insert some rows into that ta ble, now we are going to create one more as “employee”. On the “employee” table, we are going to perform all the trigger operation on it and the operations log will be stored in “EmployeeDetail”. Let’s create a trigger using the before update operation on employee table. As we can see, the trigger is created as name “before_on_employee_update”. Now, let’s use the trigger and update the row values of employee, Let’s check the table EmployeeDetail and check the action on it. As we can see, the trigger is automatically invoked and inserted a new row inside the EmployeeDetail table and the row is updated. 10.2. DROP TRIGGER To delete the TRIGGER we use the DROP TRIGGER statement, and it will delete the trigger from the database.

The syntax is as follow: DROP TRIGGER [IF EXISTS] trigger_name; Here, • Firstly, it will check the triggers_name and if it exist then delete that particular trigger. • To delete any trigger, the trigger_name should be written after the DROP TRIGGER. OR DROP TRIGGER trigger_name; It will delete the trigger without checking their existence in the database. The trigger before_on_employee_update has been deleted from the database. 10.3. BEFORE INSERT TRIGGER The before insert trigger are automatically fired before an insert occurs on the table. The syntax for before insert trigger as follow: CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name BEFORE INSERT ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body; let’s understand through an example. We are creating a table as totalamount; Now, let’s create another table as totalamountstatus to store the summary of the triggers. Lets create a before insert trigger to get the totalamount in the totalamountstatus table before a new work center is inserted into the totalamount table. The trigger is created successfully for updating before insert into the totalamount table. Let’s test the trigger by inserting the value in it. We have successfully insderted the value in the totalamount table. But the value is invoked in the totalamountstatus table. Let’s call the",

The trigger is invoked and inserted a new row into the totalamountstatus. If we insert another value that will automatically added into the present amount and return the totalamount. 10.4. AFTER INSERT TRIGGER The after insert trigger are automatically fired after an insert occurs on the table. The syntax for after insert trigger as follow: CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name AFTER INSERT ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body Let’s understand the after insert trigger using an example; Create a table named as members. Create another table as remembers. Now, create a after insert trigger as after_members_insert and that trigger insert into reminders table if the birth_date of any person is null. Let’s test the alter insert trigger. We have inserted the two rows inside the members table and the members table is shown below; As we can see here, the two rows are inserted but the birthdate of Hemant is null and as we mentioned the condition in trigger, it will invoke a message if birth date is as null. Let’s check the reminders table. As we have made the condition inside the trigger, it has invoked automatically when the birth day found as null. And the message showing as Hello Hemant,",

And the message showing as Hello Hemant, update your date_of_birth. 10.5. BEFORE UPDATE TRIGGER The BEFORE UPDATE TRIGGER is invoked automatically before an update event occurs on the table which associated with the trigger. CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name BEFORE UPDATE ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body Let’s understand through an example; Create a table as sales; Insert few rows into the sales table; Creating the BEFORE UPDATE TRIGGER, and assigning the error message as the new quantity cannot be greater than 3-times of previous. The trigger will automatically invoke and fire before updating any values in any row. Let’s update the values in row of sales table; We have updated a value of quantity where the id = 1 but it will not satisfied the condition so it will not give the error message, see the table; Let’s update the quantity as some other value which are 3-times greater than the quantity150. As we have increased the quantity as 3 -times higher than previous, it’s showing message as “the new quantity cannot be 3times greater than the current quantity”. 10.6.

The syntax for AFTER update triggers as follow: CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name AFTER UPDATE ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body Let’s understand the after update trigger with an example; we are going to use the first table as sales table and the second table as sales_changes. So let’s create the second table sales_changes. Now, let’s create the AFTER UPDATE TRIGGER; The after_update_sales trigger automatically invoked after updating any row of the sales table. Updating the quantity column in sales table, where id = 1 Let’s check the sales_changes table; As we can see the value is updated automatically in the sales_changes. 10.7.

The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way. IMAGES Docker images are a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Introduction to SQL SQL stands for Structural Query Language, and SQL is used for storing, manipulation, and retrieving data from the database. History of SQL The SQL(Structural Query language) was first created in the 1970s by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. The Query language, known then as SEQUEL, was created following the publishing of Edgar Frank Todd's paper, In 1970, A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks. In his paper, Todd proposed that all the data in a database be represented in the form of relations. It was based on this theory that Chamberlin and Boyce came up with SQL. The original SQL version was designed to retrieve and manipulate data stored in IBM's original RDBMS known as \" System R.\" It wasn't until several years later, however, that the Structural Query language was made available publicly. In 1979, a company named as Relational Software, which later beca me Oracle, commercially released its version of the SQL language called Oracle V2. Since that time, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization have deemed the SQL language as the standard language in relational database communication. While major SQL vendors do modify the language to their desires, mos t base their SQL programs off of the ANSI approved version. What",

A database is an electronic system that permits data to be easily manipulated, accessed, and updated, or an organization uses a database as a method of managing, storing, and retrieving information. Modern databases are handled using a database management system (DBMS). Relational Database Relational Database s are used to store data in tables (rows and columns ). Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. SQL and Relational Databases A Relational Database contains tables that store the data that is related in some way. SQL is the query language that allows retrieval and manipulation of table data in the relational database. The database below has two tables: one with data on Users and another with data on Products. How to run SQL Query on the local system To run the SQL query on the local system, we need to install the MYSQL community server on the system. We have given step by step installation process below.

Step 31: we can use any of the above databases by just typing use database_name 3. SQL QUERY A database most often contains tables. Some name identifies each tabl e. T he t able includes records(rows) with Data. To access those records, we need SQL Syntax. Most of the action you need to perform Database by using the SQL Statement. Note: SQL keywords are not case-sensitive (e.g., select as SELECT) o The syntax of the language describes the language element. o SQL syntax is somewhat like simple English sentences. o Keywords include SELECT, UPDATE, WHERE, ORDER BY ETC. Four fundamental operations that can apply to any databases are: 1. Read the Data -- SELECT 2. Insert the new Data -- INSERT 3. Update existing Data -- UPDATE 4. Remove Data –DELETE These operations are referred to as the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The SQL SELECT QUERY The SELECT statement permits you to read data from one or more tables. The",

Remove Data –DELETE These operations are referred to as the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The SQL SELECT QUERY The SELECT statement permits you to read data from one or more tables. The general syntax is: SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer; Example: Read the first_name and last_name from table customer. To select all columns, use * SELECT * FROM customer; The SQL SELECT DISTINCT The SELECT DISTINCT statement is to return the different values. SELECT DISTINCT first_name FROM customer; The SQL WHERE CLAUSE The WHERE clause allows the user to filter the data from the table. The WHERE clause allows the user to extract only those records that satisfy a specified condition. When we access, the Text value SQL requires single quotes around text values (many database systems will also use double quotes). And numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes. SELECT first_name FROM customer WHERE last_name = ‘perry’; When we access the Numeric field SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer WHERE active = 0; Operators in where clause = Equal > Greater than  Less than >= Greater than equal = Less than equal  > Not equal (also written as!=) BETWEEN Between a range LIKE Search for pattern IN Specify multiple possible values for a column The SQL WHERE CLAUSE WITH AND, OR & NOT A WHERE clause with AND:",

MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses ROWNUM. MySQL Syntax: SELECT first_name, last_name,email FROM customer WHERE first_name = ‘AUSTIN’ LIMIT 20; The SQL MIN() AND MAX() FUNCTION The MIN() function in SQL returns the smallest value of the selected column from the table. The MAX() function in SQL returns the largest value of the selected column from the table. MIN() Syntax SELECT MIN(address_id) FROM customer; MAX() Syntax SELECT MAX(address_id) FROM customer; The SQL COUNT(), AVG() AND SUM() FUNCTION The COUNT() function gives the number of rows that matches specified conditions. And the AVG() function in SQL returns the average value of a numeric column. The SUM() function in SQL returns the total sum of a numeric column. COUNT() Syntax SELECT COUNT(email) FROM customer; AVG() Syntax SELECT AVG(active) FROM customer; SUM() Syntax SELECT SUM(active) FROM customer The SQL LIKE-OPERATOR The LIKE operator is used with the WHERE clause to find for a specified pattern in an attribute.

The IN operator is a shorthand for various OR conditions. IN Syntax SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2,...); OR: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT); Selects all the columns of customer whose customer_id in (1,2,3): SELECT * FROM customer WHERE cutomer_id IN (1,2,3); Selects all the columns of customer whose customer_id in (1,2,3): SELECT * FROM customer WHERE cutomer_id NOT IN (1,2,3); The SQL BETWEEN OPERATOR The BETWEEN operator retrieves values within the given range. The values can be texts, numbers, or dates. The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. BETWEEN Syntax SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2; Select all the columns from the customer with customer_id between 1 to 20.

SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer_id BETWEEN 1 AND 20; Select all the columns from the customer with customer_id, not between 1 to 570. SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer_id NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 570; The SQL ALIAS Aliases are used to give a nickname to a column in a table, a temporary name. Aliases are used to make column names more readable to the user.

GROUP BY Syntax SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s) ORDER BY column_name(s); Count the number of active and non-active customers SELECT COUNT(customer_id) FROM customer GROUP BY active The SQL HAVING CLAUSE The HAVING clause is added to SQL because the WHERE keyword can not be used with aggregate functions. HAVING Syntax SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s) HAVING condition ORDER BY column_name(s); List the number of continents which has a region more than 6. SELECT * from country group by(continent) having count(region) >6; The SQL UNION The UNION operator allows the user to combine the result -set of two or more SELECT statements in SQL. Each SELECT statement within UNION should have the same number of columns. The columns in each SELECT statement should also be in the same order. The columns should also have similar data types. The SQL UNION Select column_name(s) from table1 UNION Select column_name(s) from table2; UNION ALL Query The UNION operator selects only different values by default.

To allow duplicate values, the user can use UNION ALL operator. SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 UNION ALL SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2; Note: The column names in the output are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement in the UNION. The SQL STORED PROCEDURE What is a SQL Stored Procedure? The stored procedure is a prepared SQL query that you can save so that the query can be reused over and over again. So, if the user has an SQL query that you write over and over again, keep it as a stored procedure and execute it. Users can also pass parameter s to a stored procedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value that is given. Stored Procedure Syntax CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name AS sql_statement GO; Execute a Stored Procedure EXEC procedure_name; 4. SQL JOIN The SQL Join help in retrieving data from two or more database tables. The tables are mutually related using primary keys and foreign keys. Type of Join INNER JOIN The INNER JOIN is used to print rows from both tables that satisfy the given condition. For example, the user wants to get a list of users who have rented movies together with titles of movies rented by them. Users can use an INNER JOIN for that, which returns rows from both tables that satisfy with given conditions. Fig. IN",

Syntax CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 data_type, column2 data_type, column3 data_type,.... ); The column1, column2,....., specify the names of the columns of the table. The datatype parameter specifies the type of data the column can hold (e.g., varchar, integer, date, etc.) Let’s create a customer table CREATE TABLE cutomer(id integer, first_name varchar(10), last_name varchar(10), city varchar(10), country varchar(15), phone varchar(15)); To check the schema of the table, use desc table_name. DESC customer; The SQL DROP TABLE STATEMENT The DROP TABLE statement in SQL is used to drop an existing table in a database. DROP TABLE customer; The table has dropped after running the query drop table table_name. As we can see, the table does not exist after dropped.

As we can see, the table does not exist after dropped. Now we are going to create the same table again to insert the values in that table. The SQL INSERT INTO STATEMENT The INSERT INTO statement in SQL is used to insert new records in a table. INSERT INTO query We can write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways. The first way is to specify both the column names and the values to be inserted: INSERT INTO customer(id, first_name, last_name,city,country,phone)VALUES (2, ‘Ana’, ‘Trujillo’, ‘Mexico’, ‘Mexico’, (5) 555-4729); If users are adding values for all the columns of the table, you don’t need to specify the particular column names in the SQL query. However, ensure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. The INSERT INTO query would be as follows: INSERT INTO customer VALUES (3, ‘Antonio, ‘Moreno, ‘Mexico’, ‘Mexico’, (5) 555-3932); We have inserted two rows yet. Similarly, we can insert many rows in the table. Finally, we have added ten rows as we can see in the picture below. SELECT * FROM customer; The SQL NULL VALUES What is a NULL Value?

SELECT * FROM customer; The SQL NULL VALUES What is a NULL Value? The field with a NULL value is a field with no value. If the field in a table is optional, to insert new data or update data without adding a value to this field and Then, the field will be saved as a NULL value. Note: A NULL value is not the same as a zero value, or we can say a field that holds spaces. The field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation! Insert the NULL values in tables INSERT INTO customer VALUES(11, ‘Victoria’, ‘Ashworth’, ‘London’, NULL, ‘(171) 555-1212’) As we can able to see, the last row contains one NULL value. How to check for NULL Values? To test for NULL values in the table has to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead. IS NULL Syntax SELECT * FROM customer WHERE country IS NULL; IS NOT NULL Syntax SELECT * FROM customer WHERE country IS NOT NULL; It will return those countries which have some values(expect Null values).

The SQL DELETE STATEMENT The DELETE statement in SQL is used to delete existing records in a table. DELETE Syntax DELETE FROM customer WHERE id = 11; We have deleted one row, which contains id = 11. The SQL ALTER TABLE STATEMENT The ALTER TABLE statement in SQL is used to add, modify, or delete columns in an existing table. And it also used to add and drop various constraints on a current table. 5.1.1. ALTER TABLE - ADD COLUMN IN EXISTING TABLE To add a new column in a table, use the SQL query ALTER TABLE customer ADD email varchar(25); 5.1.2. ALTER TABLE – MODIFY/ALTER COLUMN To change the data type of column values in a table, use the following syntax: ALTER TABLE customer ADD COLUMN dob date; We have assigned the dob with the datatype date.

The SQL CONSTRAINTS The Constraints in SQL can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is altered with the ALTER TABLE statement. Syntax: CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype constraint, column2 datatype constraint, column3 datatype constraint,.... ); SQL Constraints SQL constraints are used to specify any rules for the records in a table. Constraints can be used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. It ensures the accur acy and reliability of the records in the table, and i f there is any violation between the constraint and the record action, the action is aborted. Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table - level constraints apply to the whole table. The constraints are commonly used in SQL CONSTRAINTS DESCRIPTION Not Null It Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value. Unique It Ensures that all the values in a column are unique.

Foreign Key Uniquely identifies a record /row in another table Check It checks that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition Default It gives a default value for a column when no value is specified Index It is Used to create and retrieve data from the database quickly. NOT NULL CONSTRAINTS The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column NOT to accept NULL values. This imposes a field always to contain a value, which means that the user cannot insert a new record in a table or update a record without adding a value to this field. NOTE: By default, a column can hold NULL values. Create a table using SQL not null constraints The following SQL ensures that the \" id\", \"First _name\" and \"Last_name\" columns will NOT accept NULL values when the \"student\" table is created: Example CREATE TABLE student( id int NOT NULL, first_name varchar(25) NOT NULL, last_name varchar(25) NOT NULL, age int ); In the above table, it has specified the id, first_name, and last_name as not null and age as null.

SQL UNIQUE CONSTRAINT The UNIQUE constraint in SQL ensures that all values in a column are distinct. UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints both provides a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or group of columns. A PRIMARY KEY constraint, by default, has a UNIQUE constraint. However, the user can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table. Creates UNIQUE constraint on the \"id\" column when the \"person\" table is created CREATE TABLE person ( id int NOT NULL, last_name varchar(255) NOT NULL, first_name varchar(255), age int, UNIQUE (ID) ); We have applied unique constraints on id, and as we can see, it is showing as the primary key.

Create a UNIQUE constraint on the \" first_name\" column when the \" persons\" table already exists. ALTER TABLE persons ADD UNIQUE (first_name); Now we have two unique constraints(id and first_name) in the person table. To name the UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax: ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAINT UC_person UNIQUE (age, last_name); Here the age and last_name are converted as unique constraints. DROP A UNIQUE CONSTRAINT To drop a UNIQUE constraint, use the SQL query ALTER TABLE person DROP INDEX UC_Person; As we can see in the person table The unique constraint(UC_Persons) has been dropped. SQL PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINTS The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each of the records in a table. O nly ONE primary key can have in a table. A nd also, in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields). Primary keys should contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

SQL FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT A FOREIGN KEY is used to link two table s together. It is sometimes also called a referencing key. Foreign Key is a combination of columns (can be single column) whose value matches a Primary Key in the different table s. The relationship between two tables matches the Primary Key in one of the tables with a Foreign Key in the second table. If the table contains a primary key defined on any field, then the user should not have two records having the equal value of that field. Let’s create two tables using the foreign key.

SQL CHECK on CREATE TABLE SQL Query to creates a CHECK constraint on the column \"Age\" when the table \"Persons\" is created.

SQL CREATE INDEX STATEMENT CREATE INDEX statement in SQL is used to create indexes in tables. The indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than others. The user can not see the indexes, and they are just used to speed up queries /searches. Note: Updating the table with indexes takes a lot of time than updating a table without indexes. It is because the indexes also need an update. So, only create indexes on those columns that will be frequently searched against. CREATE INDEX Syntax It creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed: CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2,...); Example: Creates an index named \"idex_lastname\" on the \"LastName\" column in the \"Persons\" table: CREATE INDEX idex_",

Syntax: Create UNIQUE INDEX index_name on table_name (column1, column2,...); Note: The query for creating indexes varies among different databases. Therefore, Check the query for creating indexes in your database. DROP INDEX STATEMENT The DROP INDEX statement in SQL is used to delete an index in a table. ALTER TABLE table_name DROP INDEX index_name; 8. SQL VIEWS STATEMENT In SQL, the view is a virtual table based on the result -set of an SQL statement. A view holds rows and columns, similar to a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. C",

The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. CREATE VIEW Syntax CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2,... FROM table_name WHERE condition; Note: A view always shows up -to-date data! The database engine recreates the data, using the view's SQL statement, every time a user queries a view. Create a table customer Create a view on the table customers. Here, the view would be used to have a customer name and age from the customers table. CREATE VIEW CUSTOMERS_VIEW AS SELECT name, age FROM customers; The WITH CHECK OPTION The WITH CHECK OPTION in SQL is a CREATE VIEW statement option. The objective of the WITH CHECK OPTION is to make sure that all UPDATE and INSERTs satisfy the condition(s) in the view definition. If they do not satisfy the condition(s), the UPDATE or INSERT returns an error. The following code block has an example of creating the same view CUSTOMERS_VIEW with the WITH CHECK OPTION. CREATE VIEW CUSTOMER_VIEW AS SELECT name, age FROM customers WHERE age IS NOT NULL WITH CHECK OPTION; Here we have created a view(CUSTOMER_VIEW) with the check option. D",

DELETING ROWS INTO A VIEW Rows of data can be deleted from a view. The same rules that apply to the UPDATE and INSERT commands apply to the DELETE command. Example Delete a record having AGE = 25. DELETE FROM CUSTOMER_VIEW WHERE age = 25; Here we have deleted the row, which contains the age = 25. DROPPING VIEWS Where the user has a view, you need a method to drop the view if it is no longer needed. The query is straightforward and is given below: DROP VIEW view_name; It’s similar to the other dropping option, as we have done yet for tables. As we can see, the view is not available in the database after dropping the view. 9.

MySQL Stored Procedure What is a SQL Stored Procedure? The stored procedure is a prepared SQL query that you can save so that the query can be reused over and over again. So, if the user has an SQL query that you write over and over again, keep it as a stored procedure and execute it. Users can also pass parameters to a stored pr ocedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value that is given. 9.1.1. Creating the Stored Procedure Syntax for creating a Stored Procedure DELIMITER $$ CREATE PROCEDURE PROCEDURE_NAME() BEGIN SELECT Column_name1, Column_name2,........... FROM Table_name END$$ DELIMITER Here, the DELIMITER is not the part of Query, the first Delimiter is change the default delimiter to // and the second delimiter is change the delimiter to the default. The Stored procedure is saved automatically in the database while creation. To execute the query in MySQL, use the MySQL workbench for better user -interface, and use inbuilt databases to perform the advance MySQL queries. Here we have create a procedure called Customer, and we have mentioned few column names in it. And in last we have closed the procdure. If we want to know the output of the above query, then need to run the procedure by clicking on the execution button on workbench display. 9.1.2.

EXECUTION OF STORE PROCEDURE Execution of the Stored Procedure is very simple by using the CALL procedure_name, Execute the below query to get the result of the defined stored procedure. After calling the procedure, we are able to see the selected columns which are mentioned in the procedure. The output is as follow: Stored Procedue can have parameters,so while execution we can pass the argument and get the result. We can use control flow (like: IF, LOOP, CASE, etc.)in the stored procedure to make dynamic queries and also we can pass one stored procedure inside the other which will help to modulize the queries. 9.1.3. DROP THE STORED PROCEDURE Drop procedure use to delete the stored procedure from the databases. The following query used to delete the stored procedure for the Database: DROP Stored_procedure_name The below syntax used for conditionally drop of stored_procedure and first it check the procedure_name & if it exist then drop the stored procedure from the database. DROP PROCEDURE [IF EXIST] Stored_procedure_name; If the stored procedure is not available then it throw an error like mentioned below. 9.1.4.

The parameters make the Stored Procedure more flexible and useful. DEFINING A PARAMETERS To define the parameter inside the stored procedure, run the below query: [ IN | OUT | INPUT ] PARAMETER_NAME datatype[(length)] IN Parameter It is the default parameter in Stored Procedure and the calling program should pass an argument to stored Procedure. The valu e of IN is protected that means even the IN value is changed inside the stored procedure the original value will retained after end of the Stored Procedure. Example for IN: Create a Stored Procedure that find all the active customers by the input parameter as Active. Output: Out Parameter The value of the Output Parameter can be changed inside the Store Procedure and pass the new value while calling the Stored Procedure. Example for OUT: write a stored procedure to print the square root of a number. Output: The my_sqrt stored procedure has two parameters. input_number : it takes input from user in interger format. out_number : it store the output of the function. To print the output, we have call the my_sqrt() and pass the arguments, the first argument is user input and second is output, and to show the output use select @out_number.

We can declare and create the variable in stored procedure as follow: Here we have assigned two variables and using under stored procedure to print the difference between two numbers(x and y). Let’s call the stored Procedure to check the output of the above code. And the output is below: VARIABLE SCOPE Variable scope is for limited time period. It is defined inside the stored procedure within BEGIN and it will be out of scope once the END statement reaches. When we declare any variable inside the BEGIN END Statement, it will be out of scope once the END statement reached, there after we cannot use it. 9.2.

In MySQL, Conditional- Statement has three forms: IF-THEN, IF-THEN-ELSE and IF-THEN- ELSEIF-ELSE. Here we are going to learn about conditional statement in details one by one. 9.2.1. IF-THEN STATEMENT IF-THEN statement allow user to execute the block of SQL Query based on the specific condition. Here is the syntax for IF-THEN:",

IF-THEN STATEMENT IF-THEN statement allow user to execute the block of SQL Query based on the specific condition. Here is the syntax for IF-THEN: IF condition THEN Statement; END IF; Here, First, it will check the condition to execute the statement between the IF-THEN and END IF and if the condition is TRUE, otherwise it will go to the next END IF. In the above query, we are checking the condition as if the subject is as ‘computer’ then set the course as ‘B.Tech’. Let’s check the output of the stored procedure ‘student_ifthen’. As we can see here, the course is coming as B.Tech, because we set the condition as like that. 9.2.2. IF-THEN-ELSE STATEMENT IF-THEN-ELSE is similar to the IF-THEN. Where we will execute a block of code on a particular condition and if the condition will not satisfy then it will go for else block. The syntax as follow: IF Condition THEN; Statement; ELSE Else-Statement; END IF; Here we are going to check the subject name as ‘computer’ and if the condition is not satisfied then the else part will execute “subject is not available”.

CASE STATEMENT In this unit, we are going to learn about the CASE statement, it is an alternative conditional statement for the IF-Statement and CASE statement makes the code more efficient and readable. CASE statement has two forms: Simple CASE and Searched CASE. So, let’s learn about the CASE statement and their use using the Stored Procedure. 9.3.1. Simple CASE Statement The simple CASE statement sequentially compare the case_values in with the when_values until it finds as equal. The basic syntax for the Simple CASE statement: CASE case_value When when_values THEN statement..... [ELSE else-statements] END CASE; If the case_values will not be equal to the when_values then it will execute the else statement. And if the else is also not satisfied then it will throw an error as CASE not found for CASE Statement. To avoid the er ror when the case_value will not equal to when_values then we can use an empty BEGIN END block in the else block as follows: CASE case_value When when_values THEN statement..... [ELSE else-statements] BEGIN END; END CASE; Here we are going to do same operation as IF conditional statement. We are going to check the subjects are",

We are going to check the subjects are lying under which course using the CASE statement. Here instead of using IF -ELSE we have used the CASE Statement, under that we are checking the condition as when “condition” is true then set values. If the condition is not satisfied under the CASE statement then the ELSE block will get executed. Let’s run the query and call the Stored Procedure. Now we will print the Case statement as follow: And also, Now, Let’s see the else block, if the case_values are not satisfied then else block will executed. As we can see, the else part is executed ans showing “subject is not available”. 9.3.2. Searched CASE Statement Searched CASE Statement is similar to Simple Case Statement but it only allows you to compare a value with a set of distinct values. It is equivalent to the IF Statement but it is more readable than IF Statement. To perform the more complex matches (like ranges), we use the Searched CASE Statement. The syntax is as follow: CASE case_value When when_values THEN statement........ [ELSE else-statements] END CASE; The searched CASE statement check each Seach_condition inside the WHEN clause until it finds as TRUE then it will execute the corresponding THEN statement.

If the search_condition is not satisfied then the CASE evaluates the ELSE Statement. We are going to search the subject names and checking them that under which course the y existing. If the condition is true then it will execute and return the course name but if the condition is not satisfied then it will execute the else block. Here we are searching, when the subject name as ‘computer’ then return course as ‘B.Tech’. And if the condition is not satisfied then it will execute the else block and return as ‘subject is not available’. Let’s call the Stored Procedure & check the satisfied condition. Here we have passed the subject name as ‘computer’ and it is belongs in B.Tech. Let’s have a look on Output. Similarly, let’s execute the else part: As we can see here, it executed the else part of the Stored Procedure. And showing output as the ‘subject is not available’. CASE Vs IF STATEMENT IF and CASE are allow you to execute the block of code on specific condition. We can use both IF and CASE statement inside stored procedure, it’s completely depends on our choice. • Simple CASE statement is more efficient and readable than the IF Statement while comparing a single expression. • IF statement if better when we are executing complex expressions. • If we are using CASE statement, then make sure that at least one condition should be",

LOOP STATEMENT In MySQL, the LOOP statement is used to execute one or more than one statement repeatedly. The syntax for LOOP statement: [begin loop: ] loop Statement_list END LOOP [end_label] The loop executes the statement_list repeatedly one by one and the statement_list can be one or more and separated by the semicolon (;). To terminate the loop we use the LEAVE statement after the condition is successfully satisfied. The syntax for LOOP Statement with LEAVE Statement: [label]: LOOP IF Condition THEN LEAVE[label]; END IF; END LOOP; The LEAVE statement is exactly work as the break in other programming language. It will immediately exit from the loop. We are going to use the LOOP inside the Stored Procedure to print the even numbers from 1 to 10. To print the even number we need to implement two conditions: • The number should be less than 10. • The number should be divisible by 2. So let’s implement it using SQL query inside the Stored Procedure using the LOOP and IF-THEN Statement. The query is written below to print the even numbers from the 1 to 10. Let’s call the stored procedure to check the result. As we can see, the",

Let’s call the stored procedure to check the result. As we can see, the output is the collection of the even numbers between 1 and 10. 9.5. WHILE LOOP STATEMENT WHILE loop is execute the block of codes until the condition TRUE. The syntax is written below: [begin loop:] WHILE condition DO Statement END WHILE [end_label] The WHILE statement will check the condition at the beginning of the each iteration and if the condition satisfied, then it execute the Statement until the condition is true. We can have one or more than one statements inside the DO and END WHILE. We are going to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using while loop inside the stored procedure. Let’s call the stored procedure and check the output of the above query. We can see here, the output of the query is the collection of the numbers from 1 to 10 (excluding 10). Because we have given the condition in a while loop as 10, so till that, it will print all the numbers from 1 to till 9. 9.6. REPEAT LOOP STATEMENT REPEAT statement is used to execute one or more statements until the condition satisfied. It is similar to the DO WHILE LOOP in C.

The syntax for the REPEAT loop statement as follows: REPEAT Statement UNTIL condition END REPEAT Here, the REPEAT LOOP executes the statement before checking the condition. T herefore the statement will always execute at least once. It is also known as the post-test loop. Let’s print the numbers from 1 to 20(excluding 20) by using a REPEAT loop inside the st ored procedure. Let's check the output of the stored procedure by calling it. We have successfully printed the numbers from 1 to 20 by using the Repeat loop inside the stored procedure. 9.7. CURSOR MySQL cursor in Stored Procedure is used to iterate through a result set returned by a select statement. We use the cursor to handle a result set inside a stored procedure. A cursor allows you to iterate a set of rows returned by a select query and process through each row separately. MySQL cursor is read-only, Non-scrollable, and Asensitive. Syntax to write the cursor in the stored procedure: 1. Declare Cursor_name CURSOR from SELECT_Statement. The cursor is declared after the variable declaration; if you say before, then it will throw an error. 2. OPEN Cursor_name. We are open the cursor by using the OPEN statement and also OPEN initialize the result set for the cursor. 3. Declare CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND (Termination Statement) To declare not",

Declare CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND (Termination Statement) To declare not found a handler, we use the above query. The finished is a variab le that indicates the cursor has reached the end of the result list. 4. FETCH cursor name INTO variable_list. By using the FETCH statement, retrieve the next row pointed by the cursor and move to the next row in the result list. 5. Close cursor_name. By using the CLOSE, we deactivate the cursor and release the memory associated with it. Let’s understand cursor by implementing it on the tables. So, we are going to get emails from customers from the customer table. To implement it, we are going to use the above five steps. Let’s check the output by calling the stored procedure In the output set, we have finally extracted the top 5 emails and stored them in the email_list by using the cursor inside the stored procedure. 9.8. ERROR HANDLING MySQL ERROR HANDLING use s to encounter Errors in the stored procedure. Whenever any error occurs inside a stored procedure, it is very important to handle it.

To declare the handler, we use the following syntax: DECLARE action HANDLER FOR condition statement; If the condition matches, then the MySQL will execute the statement and continue or exit from the code block based on the action. Action accepts one of the following values: CONTINUE: the execution of the code block is continuing. EXIT: the execution of the enclosing code block, where the handler is declared or terminated. Declaring the Error Handling for CONTINUE The following handler set the value of error variable equal to 1 and continues the execution if any error occurs; DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEEPTION SET error_variable = 1 Declaring the Error Handling for EXIT The following handler rolls back the previous operation, issues an error message and exit the current code block in case of error occurs. If we declare it inside the BEGIN END block of a stored procedure, it will terminate the stored procedure immediately. Let’s understand with an example of the error handler; so we are crea ting an employeedetails table and we are trying to pass the error handler (continue and exit). We have created a table with EmployeeDetails and given a constraint as pk_EmployeeDetails with primary key (EmpID). Let’s create a procedure to handle to continue error handler.

Here we have created a procedure, that will detect the duplicasy in data and throw an error message as error occurred. We are going to pass the values inside the table. It is giving this message because one error is occurred while inserting the data into the table, and the handler is found the duplicate data. But along with this, it will print the remaining values which will not have any duplicate data. We have inserted two rows succ essfully and third is not inserted because of duplicacy of data. As we have seen the CONTINUE error handler in the above example. Now let’s do an example with EXIT error handler using stored procedure. We are going to use the same table and same procedure except the error handler. In the below example, we are going to perform the error handler using the exit error handler, which is use to do the execution of the enclosing code block, where the handler is declared or terminated. Here we are inserting the two rows as follow: But the result of the error handler using the EXIT error handler will print the error message alone. It will not show the values which are inserted inside the table. When we call the stored procedur in EXIT handler, it will just give the error message as above. 9.8.1.

ERROR CONDITIONS WITH MySQL SIGNAL/ RESIGNAL STATEMENT SIGNAL STATEMENT Signal statement is used to return an error or warning conditions to the caller using the stored procedure. It is provide and easy way to get the message and the values based on our need. The syntax for SIGNAL statement: SIGNAL SQLSTATE | condition_name; SET condition_information_item_name = value1 SET condition_information_item_name = value2 SIGNAL keyword is a SQLSTATE values or condition name declare by using DECLARE CONDITION. The condition_information_item_name can beMESSAGE_TEXT, MYSQL_ERROR, CURSOR_NAME etc. Let’s create a stored procedure w ith customer table, where we are going to check the store_id and customer details. If the record is not found then it will give an error message as the “data not found in custmer table”. Note: 45000 is a generic SQLSTATE value that illustrates an unhandled user-defined exception. Output: As we can see here, the error message is giving as the “data not found in the customer table”. RESIGNAL STATEMENT RESIGNAL STATEMENT is used to raise a warning or error messages.

It is similar to the SIGNAL statement in terms of functionality and the syntax,except: • We must have to use RESIGNAL statement inside the error handler, otherwise it will throw an error as “RESIGNAL when handler is not active”. • It can omit all the attributes of RESIGNAL statement, even the SQLSTATE values. We are creating a stored procedure to division of a number with any number, but if any number is divided by zero then it will throw an error message as the “divided by zero”. Let’s call the stored procedure to check the output, when we divide any number with zero. Here, we are dividing a n umber with zero, so it’s throwing an error message as “divided by zero/ denominator can not be zero”. 9.9.

Then specify the fu nction as DETERNMINISTIC OR NON - DETERMINISTIC. MySQL uses NON-DETERMINISTIC by default. Now we are going to create a stored function on the student table. We are going to define if the subject_name is coming then it should print as their respective course_name. Let’s check the function output by calling it under the SELECT statement. We have selected the column as subject and applying the function at the subject. Let’s check the output of the function. As we can see, the function is giving the subject with their respective courses. 9.9.2. DROP FUNCTION The DROP FUNCTION is use to drop the created stored function from the database.

Suppose, you defined a trigger and you in sert a row inside the table, then it will automatically invoked before or after the insertion of row. There are two types of the TRIGGERS: 1. Row-level-Triggers: it is activated for each row that is inserted, deleted or updated. 2. Statement-level-Triggers: it is executed for each transaction. Note: It supports only Row-level-Triggers. Advantage of Triggers • It provides a way to check the integrity in data. • It can be useful for auditing the data changes in tables • It handles the errors from the database layer. 10.1. CREATING TRIGGERS CREATE TRIGGER statement is used to create the triggers. The syntax is following: CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name BEFORE | AFTER INSERT | DELETE | UPDATE  ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body; Here, • The first line is for creating the trigger with trigger_name. • It will make the condition that the trigger invokes before or after any modification in row. • The operation we can choose as INSERT,",

Let’s understand the triggers by using an example. Now, we are going to create a table names as EmployeeDetail. And defined a primary key as id; Create another table and insert some rows into that ta ble, now we are going to create one more as “employee”. On the “employee” table, we are going to perform all the trigger operation on it and the operations log will be stored in “EmployeeDetail”. Let’s create a trigger using the before update operation on employee table. As we can see, the trigger is created as name “before_on_employee_update”. Now, let’s use the trigger and update the row values of employee, Let’s check the table EmployeeDetail and check the action on it. As we can see, the trigger is automatically invoked and inserted a new row inside the EmployeeDetail table and the row is updated. 10.2.

OR DROP TRIGGER trigger_name; It will delete the trigger without checking their existence in the database. The trigger before_on_employee_update has been deleted from the database. 10.3. BEFORE INSERT TRIGGER The before insert trigger are automatically fired before an insert occurs on the table. The syntax for before insert trigger as follow: CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name BEFORE INSERT ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body; let’s understand through an example.

The syntax for after insert trigger as follow: CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name AFTER INSERT ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body Let’s understand the after insert trigger using an example; Create a table named as members. Create another table as remembers. Now, create a after insert trigger as after_members_insert and that trigger insert into reminders table if the birth_date of any person is null. Let’s test the alter insert trigger.

The trigger will automatically invoke and fire before updating any values in any row. Let’s update the values in row of sales table; We have updated a value of quantity where the id = 1 but it will not satisfied the condition so it will not give the error message, see the table; Let’s update the quantity as some other value which are 3-times greater than the quantity150. As we have increased the quantity as 3 -times higher than previous, it’s showing message as “the new quantity cannot be 3times greater than the current quantity”. 10.6.

So let’s create the second table sales_changes. Now, let’s create the AFTER UPDATE TRIGGER; The after_update_sales trigger automatically invoked after updating any row of the sales table. Updating the quantity column in sales table, where id = 1 Let’s check the sales_changes table; As we can see the value is updated automatically in the sales_changes. 10.7. BEFORE DELETE TRIGGER The BEFORE DELETE TRIGGER are fired automatically before a delete event occurs in table. The syntax for before delete trigger as follow: TRIGGER trigger_name BEFORE DELETE ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body Let’s create a table as salary; Insert few rows into salary table; Create another table as deleted_salary to store the deleted salaries; Now let’s create a stored procedure, which contains the before delete triggers. Before delete trigger store the deleted value into the deleted_salary table. Let’s delete a row from",

As we can see here, the BEFORE DELETE TRIGGER is automatically invoked the row before event occurs on the salary table. 10.8. AFTER DELETE TRIGGER AFTER DELETE TRIGGERS are invoke automatically after deleting the event occurs on the table. The syntax for AFTER DELETE TRIGGERS as follow: CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name AFTER DELETE ON table_name FOR EACH ROW trigger_body; Create a table salary and insert few rows into the table; Create another table to store the deleted row into that,we are creating another table as deleted_salary; Now,let’s store the value of total into the deleted_salary table by using the below command. Here,we are using the SUM() function to add the salar ies from the salary table and store it into the deleted_salary as total. So the total amount is 180000. Now, Let’s create AFTER DELETE TRIGGER; We are creating a trigger which update the total salary into the deleted_Salary table after deleting from the salary table. Let’s delete a row where the employee_no = 1022 inside the",
